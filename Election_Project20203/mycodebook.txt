INTRO PRE-ELECTION POLITICAL FIGURE THERMOMETERS
        I’d like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and
        other people who are in the news these days. I’ll read the name of a
        person and I’d like you to rate that person using something we call
        the feeling thermometer.
        Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel
        favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees
        and 50 degrees mean that you don’t feel favorable toward the person
        and that you don’t care too much for that person. You would rate the
        person at the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly warm or
        cold toward the person.
        If we come to a person whose name you don’t recognize, you don’t

INTRO JOBS-STD LIVING ISSUE

          every person has a job and a good standard of living. Suppose these
          people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.

INTRO POST-ELECTION POLITICAL FIGURE THERMOMETERS
        I’d like to get your feelings toward some of our politicalleaders and
        other people who are in the news these days.I’ll read the name of a
        person and I’d like you to rate thatperson using something we call the
        feeling thermometer.
        Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel
        favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees
        and 50 degrees mean that you don’t feel favorable toward the person
        and that you don’t care too much for that person. You would rate the
        person at the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly warm or
        cold toward the person.
        If we come to a person whose name you don’t recognize, youdon’t
        need to rate that person. Just tell me and we’ll move on to the next
        one.

        We’re going to describe a seven-point scale on which the
        characteristics of the people in a group can be rated. In the first

        statement a score of ‘1’ means that you think almost all of the people
        in that group tend to be ‘hard-working.’ A score of ‘7’ means that you
        think most people in the group are ‘lazy.’ A score of ‘4’ means that
        you think that most people in the group are not closer to one end or
        the other, and of course, you may choose any number in between.

INTRO HEALTH INSURANCE ISSUE
        There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
        costs.
        Some people feel there should be a government insurance plan
        which would cover all medical and hospital expenses for everyone.
        Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.
        Others feel that all medical expenses should be paid by individuals
        through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or other company
        paid plans. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.
        And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
